# One page Site 
For this assignment I have developed and coded a one page website about Canberra's most haunted places. 

## Wire frame
The making of the one page site I had made three wireframes. The first wireframe is design in a simple layout, I wanted to create a type of scroll on the page to make images appear / fade in once scrolling down. I planned to not do this layout as I wanted to add different type of animation between the sections. 
The second wireframe is designed as a older newspaper layout. I wanted to create a newspaper theme as these stories are / or the incidents that occured had happened years ago in the 20th century, where newspaper were a source of media outlet. Also creating a easy overview of what the one page website is going to be about. It demonstrates the four sections within the site the national film and sound archive, hotel kurrajong, national museum of australia and blundells cottage being canberra's most haunted places. 
The third wireframe is more into detail of how I wanted the outcome of the website to become. I had place a key to guide and divide what section is which. The blue is the national film and archive section, and the other colours are for the ongoing three sections.
