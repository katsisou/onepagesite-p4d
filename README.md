# One page Site  

 I have developed and coded a one-page website about Canberra's most haunted places for this assignment. This website showcases the newspaper-like layout concept I have designed throughout the page. I ideally made it for the viewers to have a detailed view of the haunted places in Canberra. But I did have many ideas that I wanted to explore. For example, I wanted to do a type of jump scare website where objects will pop out when scrolling or at random times while viewing the page. I didn't plan to do this idea. Hence, I wanted to focus more on an uncomplicated output because I only had limited knowledge of JavaScript. Thus, I kept it simple with minimal animations on the page.   

## Wire frame  
### Wire frame one
I made three wireframes. I designed a simple layout for the first wireframe and wanted to create a type of scroll on the page to make images appear/fade in once scrolling down. However, I planned not to do this layout as I wanted to add different types of animation between the sections.

### Wire frame two
The second wireframe I designed was an older newspaper layout. I wanted to create a newspaper theme as these stories are / or the incidents that occurred had happened years ago in the 20th century, when newspapers were a source of media outlet. Also, create an accessible overview of what the one-page website will be about in the headings. It demonstrates the four sections within the site the national film and sound archive, the hotel Kurrajong, the national museum of Australia and Blundell's cottage being Canberra's most haunted places.

### Wire frame three
The third wireframe is more into detail about how I wanted the outcome of the website to become. I had placed a key to guide and divided what section is which. Blue is the national film and archive section, and the other colours are the three different sections. I've decided to design this layout all differently as a newspaper layout through the website. I added image boxes also intending to be animations I wanted to include. I've added many text boxes as well.

## Javascript  

This assessment focuses more on the programming aspects towards JavaScript than HTML and CSS. Hence, I intendedly was prepared to add many JavaScript functions, but from the outcome, I've only added a few. Due to having limited knowledge of JavaScript, I have only included three JavaScript functions. First, I developed a navigation scroll where once the navigation heading is clicked on, it will scroll to the section within the page. Second, I've included a button to bring the viewers back to the top of the page and change images with a simple click using the makeInvisible function. I research these functions through jQuery libraries and searches on google. 

## Overall 

Overall, I am happy with the outcome, but I would make it more of a jump scare site and would like to add more JavaScript aspect designs rather than CSS design. For example, within the section on the national film and sound archive, I didn't add any animation of some sort. I decided not to do so because I wanted viewers to see added animations gradually getting added scrolling down. But I had wanted to create a type of hover of a particular text, and then a ghost pops up, but it is more like a jump scare idea. Also, I would have preferably added a fade-in of spirits when scrolling or clicking an image to showcase a scary picture that zooms in. Although I could have done these ideas, I am still glad about how it looks.
